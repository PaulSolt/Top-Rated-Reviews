I spend 1/2 to an hour every night reading through the Top Stories tab, then finish up with their one-minute crossword.\n\nAs for the app itself, I don’t understand all the 1-Star reviews; I’ve had zero problems with it, and just can’t fathom how one could rate an app ONE star because the app has ads. It’s a newspaper folks, they have to support themselves somehow right? I would actually rate this app higher if I could just based on the fact that their ads are relatively tasteful and not CPU or bandwidth-hogging, or full-screen takeovers. I’ve really enjoyed some of the multimedia stories like the long-scrolling, annotated video graphic of Greenland’s melting ice park. Really, really love this app",

I’m giving the app two stars for offline access and the recent, excellent NYT Mag profile profile of Bill De Blasio and why the city hates him. Now onto the recent, bad updates! First, the mobile ad format functions like a pop-up that you can’t disable: the screen blacks out to load the ad before allowing you to exit the page. This format appears many times during a single session, across multiple news sections, and every time that you open the app. (Also this format seems to be used solely for “To Kill a Mockingbird” on Broadway?) This makes reading the app very inconvenient and annoying! Second, one of the latest updates eliminated the very convenient feature that allowed users to swipe between different news sections. For example, to move between three sections (like from NY to US to World) only required two swipes; to do the same now requires four taps (Back > Menu Page to choose section; repeat). In other words, it’s more convenient to enter a subway station with an MTA card than to move between sections in the NYT app. TL;DR the 2019 app updates suggest the NYT iOS team has been taking cues from editorial because reading the news is less accessible and more annoying than ever.",

I do enjoy the layout and it's esthetically very enjoyable. And the ads, no big deal! You have ads in all print newspapers and magazines that you pay for, so what's the issue? They're not interfering with the stories so I'm fine with it. What I do not like is the fact you can't add or move more of your favorite sections to the top column like before. You can only move like 5 or 6 now. Really wish you'd correct that please. \nBut other than that I still really enjoy it and will continue to subscribe. \nThank you!",

It’s as if the Times has no respect whatsoever for its own reporters and the content they produce, let alone the readers who support them.\n\nAlso, I have several iOS devices, including an older iPod Touch that runs iOS 9.3.5. It's very aggravating that this app basically doesn't work at all on that device, since the description claims it's compatible with 9.0 and above.\n\nThe New York Times remains the indispensable source for Americans who hope to be informed about what is going on in the United States and the world.

Today I read the Times through my browser just so I could use Reader View. You want to push everyone in that direction? So no one ever sees any ads at all? Maybe just try fewer ads so resorting to Reader View doesn’t become a trend. \n\nAnother thing—the blocks of links to other stories, BEFORE the end of the story I’m reading. So many times I think, wow, weird end to this article, then I realize it’s not the end, there’s another paragraph or two after links to 50 other articles. Super annoying.

I subscribe to the Times to read journalism. The new app blows up photos so that less content appears on the main page. On the old app, I can scroll through the entire paper and pick out the most interesting articles by section, just as if I were reading the physical paper. Now just a fraction are on the main page and they are completely disorganized. Please don't phase out the old app. The new one reminds me of New Coke.",

However, the larger screen makes the ads even more apparent than my large LG V40 and even in portrait mode there are huge swaths of white space on either side of the article. I will see two to three ads stretch the full screen (way too many), scroll down and see two more. The article takes up half that horizontal space. Washington Post has a MUCH better app but I can’t really afford to pay for both. Disappointed as I was excited to see what NYT did with all that space when I got my iPad. I also don’t want to let this subscription go but I will if NYT keeps pushing half baked apps with so many ads in article.\n\n(Edit) I was flipping through the Apple News app. Not only does Apple News have NYT articles outside the paywall - there are no ads!! If Apple can do it, surely you can....",

Basic navigational techniques such as swiping between sections either don’t work or were removed from the feature set. And much of the writing and article titles pander to click bait memes and techniques. Its a shame because the NYTimes has made great strides in embracing and learning digital and data driven journalism but they have left quality and the reader experience to the wayside. \n\na very simple first fix: stop showing ads to paying subscribers. I pay for quality journalism, not to see sock adverts and ad bloat.",

In fact advertisers should realize that method of presentation alienates the target audience and should not be opposed to this method of advertising. Honestly I think NYT is scamming advertisers with a number of impressions billing rate. I will be posting to Black Opium (Kering) and their advertising agency BETC about the annoying nature of these ads and I encourage all who agree to also do the same.",

This just adds more interactions with the web site and slows everything down.  Show all the articles at once without the need to revisit the website.

Further, touching the space where an ad appears (or the blank space where it will appear after downloading) while scrolling immediately redirects you to the advertiser’s web page in your browser, requiring several steps to get back to the Times. When any business places its short-term economic interest above the reasonable needs of its customers, the result is usually not good for the business (see the various airlines that have gone through bankruptcy).

People read the newspaper differently. Some, like I, enjoy scanning through the sections they have customized by swiping. Could you please bring the swipe feature back? Why does it have to be one or the other? I have radically reduced my reading of the paper because the navigation is so cumbersome now, forcing you to go back to the homepage in order to chose another section and then article. That’s three taps as opposed to one swipe. Am I missing something?",

The format is now a mess with split screens, hard to find information and overall just a crappy design. You’ve taken one of the pleasures of my day and turned it into an irritant. I hate when companies redesign just for the sake of redesign. This seems to be one of those. My guess is some IT know nothing did the redesign not understanding anything about truly wanting to read the news.",

The video player\n\nNYT makes you watch an ad before seeing their videos, even if you are a subscriber. Not uncommon, but the ad will often continue playing over the video. Often, the player crashes on me and I have to reload a story or sometimes reopen the app. This is a shame, as I have skipped videos I've wanted to watch out of sheer frustration.\n\n2. Screen orientation bug\nThis is annoying because it is sloppy app design/maintenance. When I switch screen orientation on the NYT app, as one might do when trying to watch a video embedded within a story, I try to switch back only to be taken to the very top of the page. Sometimes I’m taken to a random part of the page as I switch orientation. It’s confusing and often makes me close the app right away out of frustration. \n\nI’ve had these issues with the NYT app for years, assuming they would fix these obvious problems. That hasn’t happened. \n\nPlease fix your app.",

I never get to the bottom articles in the list anymore because it’s just too much work and I’m too frustrated to continue by that point so I put my phone down in frustration.",

The real point of this review is the new updated app.\n\nProblems with recent update:\n\n1. Less easy to navigate. Removed ABILITY TO SWEEP left/right through sections. NYT needs to bring back that functionality or make it an option.\n\n2. TOP STORIES section found on a new, worthless bottom dock, separate from other sections in the side pull down bar. NYT needs to put it back on top of side menu.\n\n3. NYT either has unfulfilled plans for the BOTTOM DOCK or they just wanted to annoy me with another pull down/up/side sliding menu for only 3 (three / III !!!) items. NYT needs to get rid of bottom dock. NYT needs to put those sections on side menu and highlight them if they want to promote them. \n\n4. Had to search for ACCOUNT SERVICE section. Easy to find before at top of side menu pull down. Now it’s hiding in the “For You” section. Not intuitive. NYT needs to put app options including acct services back on top of side pull down menu.",

There are ads in the middle of an article that are larger than the screen, causing me to either think the article ended, or to scroll beyond to continue reading. It breaks the continuity of the article.\nIf this were a free app I would understand, but it’s not. An all access account is not an insignificant purchase. Please fix this problem.",
